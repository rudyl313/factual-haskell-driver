# Installation

## Prerequisites

This driver targets [ghc 7.4.1](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/)
and [The Haskell Platform 2012.2.0.0](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/).
Please follow the installation instructions for your specific
platform to install ghc and The Haskell Platform.

You'll need a Factual account to use this dirver. If you don't have one yet, [it's free and easy to get one](https://www.factual.com/api-keys/request).


## Installation from cabal

    $ cabal install factual-api

## Installation from git

    $ git clone git@github.com:rudyl313/factual-haskell-driver.git
    $ cabal install hoauth
    $ cabal install aeson

# Tests

Load the tests file into ghci to run the tests:

    $ ghci test/Tests.hs

To run the integration tests you'll need an API key and secret, but you
can always run the unit tests:

    *Main> runUnitTests
    Cases: 51  Tried: 51  Errors: 0  Failures: 0
    Counts {cases = 51, tried = 51, errors = 0, failures = 0}
    *Main> runIntegrationTests "mykey" "mysecret"
    Cases: 10  Tried: 10  Errors: 0  Failures: 0
    Counts {cases = 10, tried = 10, errors = 0, failures = 0}

# Documentation

You can read library documentation by opening docs/index.html in
your browser or by visiting the [Hackage page](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/factual-api).

The [github wiki](https://github.com/rudyl313/factual-haskell-driver/wiki) also
provides thorough documentation and examples for each feature.

# Examples

See the examples directory for examples of each query type. To
run an example go to the project root and execute these commands:

    $ ghc -o example examples/ReadExample.hs --make
    $ ./example mykey mysecret

In this example replace mykey with your key and mysecret with your
secret. Note that compiling the source code generates .o and .hi
files in the source directories.

# Notes

## Writes

Although there is code in the current version to support API writes,
these features have not yet been implemented in the Factual API. Please
refrain from attempting to use these features until they have been
officially announced.

## Crosswalk deprecation

The Crosswalk API endpoint has been migrated into a regular read table.
For more information see the [Factual V3 documentation](http://developer.factual.com/display/docs/Places+API+-+Crosswalk).
